# Telehealth App (PIM VIII)

This project is a telehealth system developed as part of a university assignment. It demonstrates the use of **C#** and **ASP.NET** for database access and web development, with **SQLite** as the database technology. Additionally, a high-fidelity prototype for Android was created to support user interaction on mobile devices.

- **Database Management**: The `PessoaDAO` class abstracts database interactions for data management.
- **Interface**: A user-friendly interface for both web and mobile applications.

### Structure
- **MVC Architecture**: The app follows the Model-View-Controller pattern for a clear separation of concerns.
- **Responsive Web Design**: The web version uses ASP.NET Razor for rendering and handling data interactions.
- **Android Prototype**: Features a form for adding users and integrates with SQLite for data storage.

## Screenshots
- **Web Interface**: Form and table layout to manage person data.
- **Android Prototype**: A form interface similar to the web version for user data input.

## Conclusion
The app successfully showcases the integration of **ASP.NET** and **SQLite** for efficient data management, supporting telehealth services that facilitate remote consultations and medical assistance.
